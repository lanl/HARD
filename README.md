# HARD: Hydrodynamics And Radiative Diffusion

HARD is a radiation-hydrodynamics solver suite for the study of astrophysical phenomena.

HARD is based on the FleCSI framework and implemented on top of FleCSI-SP (FleCSI Specialization project).

# Spack

The easiest way to build HARD is to use *spack*:

Clone the spack repo and initialize:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:spack/spack.git $HOME/.spack
$ source $HOME/.spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

You can automate your spack setup by adding something like this to your
`$HOME/.bashrc` file:
```
# Setup spack environment
[ -f $HOME/.spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh ] && \
. $HOME/.spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

export SPACK_EDITOR=vi
```
Notice that this also sets the *SPACK_EDITOR* environment variable. This
is useful for selecting the editor program spack will use for various
interface operations (used below).

Next, create a spack *environment* for HARD and activate it:
```
$ spack env create hard
$ spacktivate hard
```
Once you are in the *hard* environment, you can specify the repository:
```
$ spack repo add /PATH-TO-HARD-CLONE/spack-repo
```
You can see the different options available for *hard* by using:
```
$ spack info hard
```
And add *hard* to the environment:
```
$ spack add hard
```
The next step is to *concretize* the
new environment. Concretization solves an optimization problem that
takes all of the package dependencies in an environment and reconciles
version and subdependency compatibility:
```
$ spack concretize -f
```
The `-f` operation forces spack to re-concretize, which is not necessary
for a new, unconcretized environment. However, it doesn't hurt, and it
is useful in most invocations to insure that spack is using the most
up-to-date config information.

To finish up the spack portion of the build, we just need to *install*
the packages:
```
$ spack install --only dependencies
```
This will fetch all of the *hard* dependencies and build them in your
local spack tree (under *$HOME/.spack/opt* to be precise). This step
will take some time.

# Build

Now that we have setup our spack environment, the rest of the build is
really easy. First, change directory into your *hard* clone and create
a build directory:
```
$ cd PATH-TO-HARD-CLONE
$ mkdir build
```
Next, change directory into the build directory and run *cmake*:
```
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```
This will configure your build with the default settings for HARD.
When cmake has completed, simply run make:
```
$ make
```
